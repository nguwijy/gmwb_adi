# gmwb_adi
This is my final year project. It aims at pricing the insurance policy of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit using the Alternating Direction Implicit method. A detailed documentation can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/orv20lusj52fzwq/interim_report.pdf?dl=0).

## Usage
- clone the project
- compile the project by "g++ main.cpp"
- run the executable target "./a.out"
- for graphical exploration of the output txt file, feel free to run visualise.R
- you may change the parameters in characteristics.hpp for different scenario
